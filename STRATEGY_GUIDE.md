# Strategic Considerations for Diecup-2 AI Implementation

## Core Strategic Principles

### 1. Waste Calculation and Optimization

**Problem**: Collecting more dice than needed to reach 5 points wastes potential scoring opportunities.

**Implementation Considerations**:

- Calculate `waste = max(0, available_points - points_needed)`
- Weight waste by rarity: `weighted_waste = waste * rarity_factor`
- Consider opportunity cost: what other numbers could benefit from these dice?
- Multiply rarity with points available and waste to create comprehensive selection value
- Use configurable weights for different strategies that require testing to optimize

**Formula**: `selection_value = (points_gained * rarity_weight) - (waste * waste_penalty)`

### 2. Probability-Based Collection Planning

**Problem**: As dice are removed during a turn, the probability of continuing to collect the same number decreases.

**Implementation Approach**:

- Create lookup tables (LUT) for continuation probabilities based on:
  - Current dice count
  - Target number type (single die vs. combination)
  - Remaining incomplete numbers on scoreboard
- Simulate thousands of games to populate probability matrices
- Use Monte Carlo methods for complex scenarios
- Consider that single dice lose fewer dice per collection, improving continuation chances
- Factor in that rare values are less likely to be removed, also improving continuation probability
- Single dice are less rare than combinations, creating interplay between rarity and continuation

**Key Metrics to Track**:

- `P(continue | dice_count, target_number, scoreboard_state)`
- Expected total points per turn for each strategy choice
- Risk of getting stuck with no valid moves

### 3. Dice Synergy and Flexibility Preservation

**Problem**: Some dice values provide more future options than others.

**Strategic Guidelines**:

- **High Synergy Values** (3,4,5): Can form multiple high-number combinations
- **Medium Synergy Values** (2,6): Moderate combination potential
- **Low Synergy Values** (1): Limited to direct collection only
- Certain dice create more favorable future states
- Mid-range values provide maximum flexibility for high-number combinations
- Extreme values offer less combination potential

**Implementation**:

```java
// Synergy weights for remaining dice after collection
private static final double[] SYNERGY_WEIGHTS = {
    0.0, 0.2, 0.6, 0.9, 0.9, 0.9, 0.4  // indices 0-6 for die values
};
```

### 4. Completion Clustering Strategy

**Problem**: Free turns from completions should be maximized through strategic timing.

**Approach**:

- Track numbers at 4/5 points (completion candidates)
- Calculate optimal completion order to maximize cascading free turns
- Prefer completing multiple numbers in sequence when possible
- Delay completions until maximum benefit can be extracted
- Since completing any number gives a free turn, clustering completions creates cascading effects
- Order of completion matters for maximizing free-turn chains

**Decision Matrix**:

- If `completion_candidates >= 2`: Evaluate clustering benefit
- If `late_game`: Prioritize immediate completions
- If `early_game`: May delay completion for better positioning

### 5. Combination Blocking Prevention

**Problem**: Collecting dice for one number can block future combinations within the same turn.

**Analysis Framework**:

- Map all possible combinations for remaining incomplete numbers
- Identify dice that contribute to multiple potential combinations
- Calculate blocking cost: `sum(blocked_combination_values * their_probabilities)`
- Factor blocking cost into selection decision
- Some dice can contribute to multiple numbers simultaneously
- A "6" can be used directly or combined with others for 7-12
- Decision depends on available dice and success probability of different paths

### 6. Expected Value Decay

**Problem**: Continuing collection becomes less valuable as turn progresses.

**Decay Factors**:

- **Turn Length**: Longer turns increase risk of getting stuck
- **Dice Reduction**: Fewer dice = lower probability of useful combinations
- **Completion Proximity**: Being close to completion affects risk tolerance
- Expected value changes as turns progress within same selection
- Early aggressive collection vs. later risk of getting stuck with unusable dice

**Implementation**:

```java
double expectedValue = baseValue * Math.pow(DECAY_FACTOR, turnLength);
```

### 7. Endgame Transition Strategy

**Problem**: Strategy must adapt as numbers get completed and options become limited.

**Phases**:

- **Early Game** (0-4 completed): Focus on establishing base scores, can afford higher risk
- **Mid Game** (5-8 completed): Balance completion timing and flexibility
- **Late Game** (9+ completed): Conservative play to avoid deadlocks, fewer targets available
- Strategy shifts dramatically as numbers get completed
- Game becomes more constrained with fewer targets
- Value of rare combinations increases exponentially

**Transition Triggers**:

- Number of completed targets
- Average points per incomplete number
- Presence of difficult combinations (high numbers with few options)

### 8. Risk Tolerance Curves

**Problem**: Optimal risk level changes based on game state and remaining targets.

**Risk Factors**:

- **High Risk**: Go for rare combinations early when recovery is possible
- **Medium Risk**: Balanced approach in mid-game
- **Low Risk**: Conservative late-game to ensure completion
- Early game can afford higher risk for rare combinations
- Late game requires conservative play to avoid complete deadlock

**Dynamic Adjustment**:

```java
double riskTolerance = calculateRiskTolerance(
    completedNumbers, 
    currentTurn, 
    estimatedRemainingTurns
);
```

### 9. Monte Carlo Lookahead

**Problem**: Complex decisions require simulation of future possibilities.

**Implementation Strategy**:

- For critical decisions, simulate N possible continuations
- Weight outcomes by probability
- Consider computational cost vs. decision quality trade-off
- Use progressive deepening for time-constrained decisions
- Simulate several rolls ahead with current dice state
- Inform whether to continue collecting or strategically end turn early

**Use Cases**:

- Choosing between multiple high-value options
- Late-game critical decisions
- Completion timing optimization

### 10. Completion Order Dependencies

**Problem**: Some numbers are strategically better to complete before others.

**Priority Framework**:

1. **Single-die numbers (1-6)**: More predictable, establish early foundation
2. **Common combinations (7,8,9)**: Moderate difficulty, good mid-game targets
3. **Rare combinations (10,11,12)**: High difficulty, save for when forced or optimal

**Dependency Rules**:

- Complete easier numbers first to maintain dice flexibility
- Avoid early completion of numbers that use versatile dice values
- Consider completion bonuses in timing decisions
- Some numbers are prerequisites for others strategically
- Completing single-die numbers early might be beneficial due to predictability
- Leave dice flexibility for harder combinations later

### 11. Risk vs. Certainty Trade-offs

**Problem**: Guaranteed small gains might prevent potentially larger gains.

**Considerations**:

- Taking guaranteed small gain vs. potential larger gain
- If dice could form multiple combinations, choosing "safe" option might block better opportunities
- Decision depends on subsequent rolls within same turn
- Balance immediate scoring against future potential

### 12. Multi-Path Dependency Analysis

**Problem**: Dice contributing to multiple potential combinations require complex evaluation.

**Analysis Required**:

- Map all possible uses for each die value
- Calculate success probability for each path
- Consider interaction effects between different choices
- Evaluate which paths are more likely to succeed given current game state

## Implementation Architecture

}
```
