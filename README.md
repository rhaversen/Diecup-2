### Diecup-2 Game Objective

Win by collecting 5 points for each number (1-12) on the scoreboard. The final score is measured by how many turns it takes to complete this goal.

### Setup

- Scoreboard contains numbers 1 through 12, each requiring 5 points to complete
- Start each turn with 5 dice

### Turn Mechanics

1. **Roll Phase**: Roll all available dice (starting with 5)
2. **Selection Phase**: Choose valid dice combinations:
    - **Numbers 1-6**: Select a single die matching the number directly
    - **Numbers 7-12**: Select any two dice whose sum equals the target number
3. **Scoring**: Add 1 point to the corresponding number on the scoreboard
4. **Continue**: Remove selected dice and roll the remaining dice
5. **Repeat**: Continue selecting the initial selection value and rolling until no valid moves remain or all dice are used

### Special Rules

- **Completion Bonus**: When any number reaches 5 points, all dice return to the cup and you start the next turn with 5 fresh dice
- **Triple Bonus**: If you score the same number (7-12) three consecutive times in one turn, all dice return to the cup for the next selection
- **Turn End**: A turn ends when no valid dice combinations can be made or all dice have been used

### Winning Condition

The game ends when all numbers (1-12) have reached 5 points each. Your score is the total number of turns taken to achieve this.
